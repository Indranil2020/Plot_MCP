ABSTRACT
The electronic band structure of strained GaSbBi/GaAs heterostructures are
investigated using a 14 band k·p Hamiltonian which is an extended form of the 12
band Valance band Anticrossing (VBAC) matrix. The shift in the valence and
conduction subbands due to the incorporation of Bi in GaSb/GaAs Type II system
are calculated and compared with the available experimental data. Unlike the band
gap reduction of 51 meV and enhancement of spin-orbit splitting energy by ~ 27
meV in bulk GaSb0.987Bi0.013, 7.3% compressive strain in GaSbBi/GaAs quantum
wells (QWs) amends the scenario completely by increasing the band gap to 1.12
eV and the spin-orbit splitting energy to 1.217 eV. The dispersion relations and
effective masses of the carriers in the crystal directions Δ, Λ, and Σ are calculated
near the Γ point using this Hamiltonian yield some interesting results. The
variation of the optical gain with the density of injected carriers and dimension of
the QW is calculated and the peak of the gain curve exhibits a shift towards lower
wavelengths with the decrease in the width of the QWs.
Quaternary GaAsSbN is a promising candidate for use in GaAs-based
optoelectronic devices in the 1.33-1.55 μm wavelength region. We have calculated
the band structure of dilute nitride-antimonide GaAs1--x--yNxSby alloys, lattice
matched to GaAs, using Band anticrossing (BAC) and Valence Band Anticrossing
(VBAC) model in conjugation with the k·p Hamiltonian method. This
mathematical model in the form of a 16 band Hamiltonian matrix is used to
examine the shift of different bands as a function of Sb concentration for both bulk
and quantum well structures for GaAsSbN/GaAs. The band parameters such as
energy gap, spin-orbit splitting energy, carrier effective masses, band offsets, and
strain generated due to the growth of GaAsSbN/GaAs heterostructures as a
function of Sb and N concentrations are calculated and compared with the recent
experimental data. The substitution of As atoms due to the incorporation of N and
Sb impurity atoms causes a significant band gap reduction of ~330 meV for
GaAs0.931Sb0.05N0.019 alloys. The enhancement of spin-orbit splitting energy causes
a crossover between Eg and ΔSO for Sb and N concentration of 27 and 10 at %
respectively. Suitable tuning of the band offset values with Sb and N
concentrations makes GaAsSbN/GaAs alloy system an efficient alternative for
band gap engineering and fabricating photonic device structures.

Introduction

Selection of suitable materials with excellent structural and optical characteristics
forms the basis for the fabrication of optoelectronic devices. Bi-containing III-V
alloy, GaSbBi is one of such potential candidate for the realization of numerous
applications in the technologically important 2-5 µm mid-infrared window, such as
spectroscopy, materials processing, chemical and biomolecular sensing, security
and industry due to its important property of band gap tuning [1]. Substitution of
the Sb atoms by Bi atoms in GaSb helps in reducing the band gap by the upward
shift of the light hole/heavy hole band and subsequent lowering of the conduction
band minimum owing to Virtual Crystal Approximation (VCA) [2]. There are a
number of reports on the theoretical modeling [1-5] and experimental growth [6-9]
of this bulk ternary alloy GaSb1-xBix. Band gap reduction by about 40 meV/at%Bi
and enhancement of spin-orbit splitting energy by 21 meV/at%Bi is obtained using
VBAC Model [1] which is consistent with the experimental results [6-9]. In
addition to GaSbBi alloys, Type-II GaSb/GaAs quantum dot (QD) structures have
been the subject of study by the researchers due to their applications in LEDs
involving dipole transitions [10], charge storage devices [11,12] Intermediate Band
solar cells [13] and quantum-dot infrared LED [14]. Type-II quantum well (QW)
structures have fascinated the researchers to resolve the major challenges, like
charge separation due to the existence of the built-in electric field inside the QW
[15]. The primary advantage of using Type II structures in optoelectronic
applications is that it helps to improve the electron-hole envelope function, which
enhances the radiative efficiency of developed heterostructures [16]. A recent
report on the growth and photoluminescence studies of strained Type II
GaSbBi/GaAs QDs produced some interesting results [17].
Dilute III-V Nitride alloys have attracted the attention of the researchers in the past
few decades due to their unique physical properties such as simultaneous reduction
of band gap and lattice parameter of the corresponding III-V host lattice and
potential applications in GaAs-based optoelectronic and photonic devices
operating in the strategically important telecommunication wavelength range of
1.3-1.55 µm [18-21]. GaAsSbN is a favorable alternative for achieving longer
wavelengths with lower N concentration compared to GaInAsN [22]. A Smaller
value of energy band gap is achievable with GaAsSbN than with GaInAsN for the
same nitrogen concentration as GaAsSb presents a stronger bandgap bowing than
GaInAs [23]. Harmand and co-workers reported a band gap reduction of 180 meV
for a nitrogen incorporation of 1% in GaAsSbN/GaAs quantum wells (QWs) [2123]. Though GaAsSbN (QW) structures are not suitable for the fabrication of 1.3
µm GaAs-based lasers due to their weaker electron confinement compared to
GaInAsN QWs, they are suitable for 1.55 µm lasers for the lesser percentage of
nitrogen required to achieve the desired wavelength [21]. Higher concentration of
nitrogen often leads to the formation of N-related defects which degrades the

1

minority-carrier lifetime and efficiency in GaInAsN based devices [24]. The
presence of a single Group III element in GaAsSbN makes the nitrogen
concentration insensitive to the presence of Sb unlike GaInAsN alloys where In is
reported to lower the concentration of N atoms [22]. This makes the electronic
band structure of GaAsSbN alloys less dependent on the alloy configuration [21].
The fact that GaAsSbN alloys can yield band gap values as low as 1 eV while
maintaining lattice match with GaAs makes them ideal candidates for the
fabrication of multijunction solar cells [24]. Thermal annealing in Sb-based alloys
such as GaAsSbN and InGaAsSbN needed for the optimization of emission causes
a larger blue-shift of the band gap compared to other dilute nitrides [25]. A recent
report by Iyer et al. suggested that reducing the dimensionality of GaAsSbN alloy
systems to nanowires can lead to the annihilation of N-induced point defects and
enhanced photon collection for improving the performance of these dilute nitride
nanowires in nanoscale optoelectronic devices [26]. The band gap reduction in
dilute GaAsSbN alloys is explained using a double band anticrossing (BAC) model
by Lin et al. which is a combination of BAC model for GaAsN and Valence BAC
model for GaAsN [19].
Here we have calculated the band structure of GaSbBi/GaAs type-II QWs by
including the effect of strain and bulk GaSbBi using14 band k·p Hamiltonian to
estimate the band gap, spin-orbit splitting energy, effective masses, dispersion
relations and band offsets with variable bismuth concentration. We have also
calculated the optical gain of type-II QW structures as a function of well width and
doping concentration.
We have also investigated the band structure of GaAsSbN alloys and
GaAsSbN/GaAs QWs using a 16 band k·p Hamiltonian. We have extended the 8
band Hamiltonian for GaAs to a 16 band k·p model to take into account the effects
of the incorporation of Sb and N related impurities more accurately. The influence
of these impurities on the band parameters such as band gap and spin-orbit
splitting energy, electron and hole effective masses, conduction band and valence
band offsets for GaAsSbN alloys and QWs are discussed. The dissertation is
organized as follows. Section 2 gives the details of theoretical models and material
parameters for the calculation of electronic band structure and related band
parameters of binary GaAs and GaSb, ternary GaSbBi/ GaAs QW and Quaternary
GaAsSbN. The results of the 8 band,14 band and 16 band k·p calculations for the
corresponding alloys and QWs are presented in Section 3. The effects of strain on
the band structure are also discussed in this section. Section 4 summarizes the
contribution of our work in the relevant field and future work.

Theoretical Framework

For appropriate characterization of any material, both empirical and theoretical
analysis is required. For theoretical analysis, there are various kind of tool with
their own better hub such as DFT, Tight Binging method, Pseudopotential method,
The k.p method. As per the subject of interest, specific methods are being used;
here we are interested in optoelectronic behavior, which primarily depends on the
band edge of III-V materials. As a result, we will focus on The k.p Hamiltonian,
which offers precise and reliable results near the band edge.
2.1

The k.p Hamiltonian

This numerical powerful tool helps to analyze the conduction band and valance
band near the band edges of direct band-gap III-V semiconductors, where the wave
vector k changes by a little amount from a vector k0 where a local maximum or
minimum occurs. The k.p method was introduced by Bardeen [27] and Seitz [28],
the method offers numerical analysis of Eigenvalue of 8 8 system Hamiltonian
and provides basic 4 band electronic band structure of III-V semiconductors. The
method has also been used widely by many researchers to semiconductors [29-34].
We will discuss Kane’s model [31,32], which takes into account the spin-orbit
interaction, and Luttinger-Kohn’s models [33] for degenerate bands and further
modification for Valance Band Anticrossing (VBAC) model for 14 band and 16
band respectively along with strain influence. These models are very popular in
studying bulk and quantum well semiconductors and have been used during the
past few decades. The Schrödinger equation for single electron

The III-V zinc-blende crystal (GaAs) formed by the contribution of outermost
electron of 4s2 and 4p1 electrons with valence III (Ga) atoms and 4s2 and 4p3
electrons with valence V (As) atoms, as result the electron wave functions are plike near the top of the valence band and S-like near the bottom of the conduction
band. The first four basis functions are respectively degenerate with the last four
basis functions; hence the 8x8 interaction matrix becomes [35]

EG and Δ are the band gap and spin-orbit splitting of the material; Kane matrix
element is denoted by P [2]. The valence band Luttinger parameters [36] (γ1L, γ2L,
γ3L) used in 6-band Hamiltonian have to modify to use in 8-band Hamiltonian,
which are called modified Luttinger parameters (γ1, γ2 , γ3 ) and the relation
between them is as follows [35-37]:

Evaluating the Eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian matrix, electronic band structure can
be obtained along with that effective mass also can be analyzed near the band edge.
Further incorporation of dilute impurity atoms will influence the host material's
system Hamiltonian and degenerate the Eigenstates, which leads to Band
Anticrossing Model.

Valance Band Anti Crossing Model

Incorporation of dilute impurity atoms create localized isoelectronic defect states
near the extended valance band; those defect states interact with the subbands of
the host material and split of the corresponding subbands into E+ and E- subbands,
where E+ and E- prolong the extended nature of host material and the defect states
respectively [11]. As a result effective Band gap reduces and spin-orbit splitting
energy changes accordingly. Defect state will form near conduction band or
valance band depend on electronegativity of the impurity atoms; high
electronegative impurity atoms like N create defect state near conduction band and
impurity atoms like Bi, Sb will create defect states near valance band of host
material, which is illustrated as valance band anticrossing (VBAC) or 12 band k.p
Hamiltonian. Incorporation of less electronegative and high volume atoms (Bi, Sb)
in III-V host material (GaAs, GaSb) generate localized isoelectronic states near the
valance band of the host material. The 6 (SB, Bi) related p-like impurity states
perturb the basic 6  6 system Hamiltonian [2] and result in 12  12 Hamiltonian

Where Cimp is the coupling parameter and Ei mp , Eimp  so is single atom energy state

The E  states hold the extended host atom's state and E  states carry the nature of
impurity atom's state. The E  states lifted upward and E  states dragged down
with respect to the host atom's state as a result effective band gap reduction occurs
[8], which is the key feature of VBAC model. Tough 12 band VBAC model
remains silent about conduction band and offers detailed information about valance
only but conduction band can be perturbed by conduction band offset between
endpoint binary atoms and strain without incorporating another high
electronegative impurity (N), which can be observed by 14 band VBAC model.

14 Band Model: GaSb1-xBix

14 band VBAC is an extension of 12 band VBAC which draws attention towards
the modifications in conduction band without introducing any s-like isoelectronic
defect state near conduction band edge of host atoms. Here we have considered
GaSb as a host material where heavier dilute Bi replace the Sb atom and creates plike defect states near valance band edge and splits the valance subbands of GaSb
into E  and E  states. Corresponding Bi impurity states and band offsets between
the endpoint binary atoms GaSb and GaBi perturb the H88 and generate the

16 Band Model : GaAs1-x-ySbyNx

The incorporation of N and Sb in GaAs causes the perturbation of the conduction
and the valence bands respectively. The VBAC and Conduction Ban Anticrossing
(CBAC) models take into account the effect of this perturbation using a 16 band
Hamiltonian H16×16 obtained by the inclusion of 6 Sb-related and 2 N-related
impurity states to the basic 8 band Hamiltonian of the host semiconductor matrix
[38,40,41]. While the CBAC Model predicts the lowering of the Conduction Band
Minimum (CBM) due to a quantum anticrossing interaction of N-related impurity
states with the extended CB states of GaAs, the modification in the valence band
structure due to the upward shift of the heavy hole (HH)/light hole (LH) and spinorbit split-off (SO) bands is well-explained by the VBAC Model [2]. Electronic
band structure of GaAs1-x-yNxSby can be determined using this Hamiltonian which
is the modified form of the 8 band k·p Hamiltonian based on the eight-band
second-order Kane model applied to the zinc blende structure and Löwdin
perturbation theory [35]. The resultant (16×16) matrix of the Hamiltonian can be
written as [38,40]:

 H 8168
V8N8, Sb ( y, x) 
H1616   N , Sb

The matrix elements for H16×16 are as defined in ref. [38] for bulk GaAsNSb alloys
grown on GaAs substrates. where H8168 consist of H88 with slide change in
diagonal elements as follows

C16  C 8  ECBM ( x, y ) ,

The above discussed VBAC and BAC model can be extended further for quantum
confined structures where strain will play a crucial role , discussed latter section.

Strain Effect

The effects of strain are of particular interest in Quantum confined structures to
have better optical properties. Strong lattice mismatch with the host substrate
offers a large conduction and valence band offsets. Hydrostatic strain acts
uniformly irrespective of carrier's effective mass of corresponding subbands
nevertheless shearing strain acts in a different way to HH and LH sub band, which
breaks the degeneracy of HH and LH at Γ=0, predicted by VBAC model. Hence
the strain influenced perturb Hamiltonian is calculated by using the Bir-Pikus
Hamiltonian [42] given bellow

Optical Properties

Dilute III-V N or Bi are the promising candidate for optoelectronic devices owing
to their prominent direct band gap nature along with that wide range of wavelength
response. Both the inter band and inter sub band transitions offers wide range of
illumination and absorption. The band offsets play crucial role in direct transitions,
carrier confinement and electron hole wave function's overlap, which can be tuned
by varying the impurity concentration.
2.6.1 Band Offset
Band offsets define the structures and types of QWs or QDs and enlighten on
confinement of carriers and ranges of wavelength response. Band offsets can be
calculated as mention above where Effective band offsets can be as follows [45]

Ec = |Ec (x, y) - Ec (GaAs / GaSb)|

2-22

Ev = |Ev (x, y) - Ev (GaAs/ GaSb)|

2-23

2.6.2 Optical Gain
The optical gain g     for GaSbBi/GaAs type-II QWs is calculated by
considering all the transitions between respective sub bands as per density matrix
theory [47,48]. A conformist method [49] based on the intra band relaxation time
 in  approximation convoluted with a Lorentzian function with suitable
broadening time ( 1 1014 s ) is used to evaluate optical gain spectra[50] as follows:

GaSbBi whereas 16 band model offers overall knowledge about quaternary
GaAsSbN.

Electronic Properties

The Eigen values at specific point of k space present the band diagram near band
edge, which also can provide the dispersion relation along different symmetric
direction and also inform about band offsets, which are crucial parameters for
optoelectronic device applications. Details information about all the host binary,
ternary and quaternary is discussed bellow.

splitting bands are represented by the indices cb, hh, lh and so respectively.
Solution of the 14 band Hamiltonian of Equation 2-10 yields the E-k diagrams
shown in Figure 3.3 and Figure 3.4. Initially, we have studied the band structure of

18

bulk GaSb0.987Bi0.013 alloys using VBAC model [2] in which we can observe that
an incorporation of 1.3% Bi in GaSb pushes the conduction band minima
downward by 36 meV and shifts the valance band maxima upward by 15 meV
which implies a band gap reduction of 51 meV (~39 meV/%Bi). The spin-orbit
split-off band also exhibits an upward movement of 10.3 meV. Our calculated
value of band gap reduction agree well with experimental results [3,4,7-9].
However, the generation of strain due to the growth of GaSbBi/GaAs QWs affects
the BS significantly. The splitting of the LH and HH bands and the upward shift of
the CB results in a huge band gap of 1.12 eV. The separation of the LH and HH
bands by about 373 meV is comparable to that of 400 meV [17] calculated using
macroscopic theory of elasticity [53]. The spin-orbit split-off band ESO+ also moves
downward by 230 meV which increases the spin-orbit splitting energy appreciably.

Higher value of ΔSO than Eg observed in GaSbBi [5] suppresses the Auger
recombination loss mechanisms in optoelectronic devices such as LASERs and
photodetectors thereby enhancing their efficiency and also reducing the spin
lifetime of the conduction electrons. Therefore, GaSbBi system may find potential
applications in the area of Spintronics [54-56].

The carrier confinement and strain immensely affects the CB and causes an
upward shift of CB by 0.66 eV with respect to the host CB. As can be observed
from Figure 3.5, CB and E+ energy levels corresponding to the LH, HH and SO
sub bands for GaSbBi/GaAs QWs show large deviation from their respective
values for bulk GaSbBi alloys. However, the E- sub bands are the least affected.

meV/%Bi, 21.3 meV/%Bi, 12.8 meV/%Bi and 11.2 meV/%Bi respectively and are
calculated by solving the equations 2.11 and 2.12. Figure 3.6 clearly shows that the
combined effect of strain and confinement potential increases the band gap for
GaSbBi/GaAs QWs in comparison to GaSbBi alloys. However, introduction of Bi
impurities in GaSb reduces the band gap by 35 meV/%Bi and 39.1 meV/%Bi
respectively for QWs and bulk.

It can also be observed that for a Bi incorporation of 13.2 at%, the band gap for
QWs is equivalent to the band gap of GaSb alloys. A recent report by Das et al. on
GaSbBi/GaAs Quantum dots demonstrated a band gap of 1.25 eV for a Bi
incorporation of 1.2 at%Bi using photoluminescence measurements [17]. The
value of the band gap of 1.17 eV calculated theoretically in this report exactly
matches our calculated value of band gap for GaSbBi/GaAs QWs. We have
calculated the dispersion relation Eu±(k) for the different sub bands along the three
high symmetry k- directions ( Δ, Λ and Σ ) at  point using the k∙p Hamiltonian to
observe the effect of inclusion of Bi on effective masses mu* ( ) of carriers in
GaSb0.987Bi0.013/GaAs QWs where u = cb, hh, lh and so. Figure 3.7 depicts the
calculated variation of the different energy levels as a function of k where it can be
observed that only the variation of Eso+ is isotropic in all orientation of k upto
k=0.10 Å-1. On the other hand, Ecb- and Eso- reflects a moderate change with kdirection beyond the value of k=0.12 Å-1. Ehh/lh± bands maintain their p-like nature
and vary appreciably with the high symmetry k directions.

mole fraction at 300K.
Unlike the linear increase in VBO and CBO, the VBO and CBO ratio changes nonlinearly with Bi mole fraction shown in Figure 3-10 and Figure 3-11. The offset
ratios can be defined as the ratio between the change in offset values to the change
in band gap as a result of the incorporation of Bi impurity atoms. It can be
observed from the figures that the CBO and VBO ratios exhibit opposite nature,
i.e. while CBO ratio increases with Bi concentration, VBO decreases. Considering
strain effect CBO and VBO have been calculated shown in Figure 3-12. It can be
observed that shearing strain breaks the degeneracy of heavy hole and light hole
offset.

gap energy EG due to the downward movement of ECB- and upward movement of
EHH/LH+
Figure 3.13 shows the relative energy positions of the CB, HH/LH and SO sub
bands as a function of Sb mole fraction under lattice-matched condition at the Γ
point. The above figure is obtained by solving the 6 band Hamiltonian in Equation
(2.15) that yields 6 distinct Eigen values corresponding to Equations 2.16-18. The
anticrossing interactions of the CB, HH/LH and SO sub bands with the N and Sb
related impurity states causes the repulsive movement of the E + and E- energy
levels. The incorporation of N and Sb in GaAs pushes the energy levels ECB- in the
downward direction by about 90 meV/%Sb and EHH/LH+ in the upward direction by
10.3 meV/%Sb thereby causing a band gap reduction of ~100 meV/%Sb. The
contribution of the lowering of the conduction band minimum to the total band gap
reduction is about 90% which is due to the large value of the coupling parameter
CN. The spin-orbit split-off energy level ESO+ moves upward by 6 meV per y=0.01
which indicates that there is a slight increase of the spin-orbit splitting energy.
Figure 3.14 shows the band structure of GaAs0.931N0.019Sb0.05 in the Δ and Λ
directions near the Γ point at room temperature. As can be observed from this E-k
diagram, the impurity levels EN, ESb and ESb-SO interacts with CB, HH, LH and SO
bands of the host semiconductor to split them into their corresponding spindegenerate E+ and E- sub bands in accordance with Pauli’s exclusion principle. The
lowering of the CBM (shown by an arrow) and the slight upward movement of the
HH/LH band is the primary factor responsible for band gap reduction in this
quaternary alloy.

eV as a function of both Sb and N mole fraction. Experimental values of band gap
are added from the literature and good agreement exists between our calculated
results and experimental values.
ΔSO+ increases by ~22 meV. This enhancement of spin-orbit splitting energy
for GaAsNSb is much smaller in comparison to that of GaAsNBi (56
meV/%Bi) [40]. We have represented a crossover between band gap energy Eg
and spin-orbit splitting energy ΔSO+ in
Figure 3.15. This crossover obtained for Sb = 27% and N = 10% results in the
formation of Eg<ΔSO regime which is known to suppress the Auger recombination
processes in optoelectronic devices. Our calculations show excellent agreement
with the experimental values of Eg and ΔSO illustrated in the literature [19,57].
Figure 3-16 shows the variation of energy band gap for GaAsNSb alloys as a
function of both Sb and N concentration at room temperature. It can be observed
from the graph that VBAC calculated values of the band gap agrees well with the
experimental data [22,58-68]. Band gap values in the range 0.4 eV-1.3 eV can be
obtained by varying the Sb and N mole fractions. GaAsNSb can be used as 1 eV

symmetry crystal directions (Δ, Σ and Λ). From Figure 3.17, we can observe that
out of all the eight sub bands, only ECB- and ESO+ are isotropic with k vector
orientation. The bands EHH± and ELH± are highly anisotropic due to their p-like
symmetry [40]. The variation of the effective masses m*(Γ) as a function of Sb

The larger value of CBO is beneficial in the sense that the optoelectronic devices
fabricated using GaAsNSb could provide better electron confinement. Unlike the
linear increase in VBO and CBO, the VBO and CBO ratio changes non-linearly
with Sb and N mole fraction. The offset ratios can be defined as the ratio between
the change in offset values to the change in band gap as a result of the
incorporation of Sb and N impurity atoms. It can be observed from the figures that
the CBO and VBO ratios exhibit opposite nature, i.e. while CBO ratio decreases
with Sb and N concentration, VBO increases.

greater than the LH and HH band offsets increasing linearly. While the band offset

One of the significant parameters for the calculation of optical gain is the band
offset which is obtained using Equation (2.26-28). Figure 3.34 shows the Type II
band structure of a 10 nm wide GaSb0.987Bi0.013/GaAs QWs in accordance with
[17]. The different excited energy states for heavy hole, light hole and conduction
band electrons are also depicted in the figure. The large values of HH, LH and CB
offsets of 0.99 eV, 0.4425 eV and 0.62 eV respectively results in higher
confinement potential of both the electrons and holes in the CB and VB.
Substantial refractive index difference between GaSb and GaAs and higher values
of band offsets provide better optical and carrier confinement that leads to the
enhancement of lasing action for GaSbBi/GaAs QW structures. Moreover, unlike
Type I band structure in GaAsBi/GaAs QWs, Type II structure in GaSbBi/GaAs
QWs offers higher overlap between electron and hole wave function which

37

improves the density of state and owing to higher carrier accumulation luminosity
of the optoelectronic devices improve for Type II QWs [70]. Moreover, lesser
amount of compressive strain (7%) due to dilute Bi concentration helps to achieve
longer emission wavelength with larger material gain in GaSbBi/GaAs QWs.

We have also calculated the values of intersubband transitions occurring between

state is important from the point of view of absorption of normally incident light
by holes in GaAs based p-Quantum Well Infrared Photodetecors (QWIP) in the
absence of an optical grating [71].

The inter subband transitions in the Conduction Band ranges from 0.17-0.45 eV
whereas the transitions between the LH→HH/HH→HH/LH→LH subbands lie in
the range 0.14-0.80 eV. It has been found out numerically that the hole
intersubband absorption of normally incident radiation in the absence of an optical
grating would be largest for transitions from a pure heavy hole state to a pure light
hole state [72]. The sub band energy levels, effective masses and band offsets are
used to calculate the optical gain with respect to the inter subband transitions.
Figure 3.36 shows the shift of the peak of optical gain with the variation in injected
surface carrier density of the GaSb0.987Bi0.013/GaAs QW with 10 nm active layer.
Increasing the rate of injected carrier density improves the difference between the
Fermi function which leads to gain improvement within the desired mid infrared

39

region. For quantum confined structures like QWs, the sub bands act as a tuning
parameter for optoelectronic devices. The variation of the confinement length of
the QWs causes variation in the sub bands Enc and E mv which leads to change in
effective band gap of QWs and changes the peak gain position. We have analyzed
the confinement effect on optical gain for a surface carrier density of 3×10 16 m-2
which is shown in Figure 3.37.

Reducing the dimension of the active region of the QWs causes a shift of the peak
energy position towards lower wavelengths for a constant injected carrier density
and this occurs due to the inverse squared dependence of the energy of the sub
bands on the width of the QWs. Stronger confinement of the carriers due to the
overlap of the exciton wave functions increases the transition energy for the
carriers which shifts of the peak of gain towards lower wavelengths which is
shown in Figure 3.37. Figure 3.38 depicts the opposite characteristics of the optical
gain and peak energy position with the dimension of the QWs.

compressive strained QWs. Hence, longer emission wavelengths in the
telecommunication window (1.3-1.55 µm) can be achieved for
GaAs0.94N0.01Sb0.05/GaAs QWs. Clearly, the figures show that GaAsNSb/GaAs
QWs are Type I structures with strong confinement potential for both holes and
electrons.

Conclusion and Future Work

A mathematical model based on VBAC is used to calculate the electronic band
structures of GaSb1-xBix for x= 0.013 along the <100> and <111> both for bulk and
strained layer grown on GaAs. VBAC model predicts that for an incorporation of
1.3% Bi in GaSb conduction band minima is pushed downward by 36 meV and the
valance band maxima is shifted upward by 15 meV which produces a band gap
reduction of 51 meV. The splitting of the LH and HH bands and the upward shift
of the CB results in a huge band gap of 1.12 eV for GaSbBi/GaAs QWs. The
separation of the LH and HH bands by about 373 meV is mainly due to the
generation of strain for the large lattice mismatch between GaSbBi and GaAs. The
downward shift of the spin-orbit split-off band ESO+ by 230 meV increases the
spin-orbit splitting energy. The carrier confinement and strain immensely also
affects the CB shifting it by 0.66 eV with respect to the CB of GaSb. The
calculated dispersion relations show that Eso+ is isotropic in all orientation of k upto
k=0.10 Å-1 and Ecb- and Eso- reflects a moderate change with k-direction beyond the
value of k=0.12 Å-1 unlike Ehh/lh± bands. The increase in the effective masses of the
charge carriers is also due to the confinement of electrons in the QW structure. The
*
*
*
carrier effective masses mhh
 , mlh  and mso in the upper sub bands are almost

isotropic. The large values of HH, LH and CB offsets for GaSbBi/GaAs QWs
results in higher confinement potential of both the electrons and holes in the CB
and VB. The optical gain of the QWs increase with an increase of the injected
carrier charge density. However, the increase in the dimension of the QWs reduces
the optical gain for a constant injection carrier density due to the reduction in the
density of the states in the sub bands. The peak of the optical gain curve exhibits a
blueshift due to the reduction in the width of the QWs.
GaSbBi/GaAs QW systems are suited for applications in optoelectronic devices
due to the innumerous advantages that these systems provide. Firstly, GaSbBi has
a large spin orbit splitting energy and incorporation of a few percent of Bi results
in the formation of ∆SO>Eg regime for low temperatures which is not only vital for
spintronic applications but it also inhibits the Auger recombination losses that
degrades the efficiency of LASERs. Secondly, Bi perturbs only the valence band
of GaSb and hence the electron mobility remains unaffected. This improves the
speed response and sensitivity of GaSbBi/GaAs based photodetectors.
The enhanced optical as well as carrier confinement of GaSbBi/GaAs QWs
improves the lasing action of such systems to a great extent. The inter sub band
transitions occurring in GaSbBi/GaAs QWs, mainly between the HH and LH sub
bands allows normal incidence inter subband absorption in p-QWIPs in the
absence of an optical grating. Moreover the inter subband transitions occurring
between the VB and CB sub bands could make possible the fabrication of LASER
diodes operating in the 1.5-2.2 µm mid-infrared region.

We have calculated the band structure of GaAsNSb alloys lattice matched to GaAs
substrates and GaAsNSb/GaAs QWs using a 16 band k·p Hamiltonian. Our
calculations show that a significant band gap reduction of 330 meV is obtained for
GaAs0.931N0.019Sb0.05 alloys lattice matched to GaAs. The spin-orbit splitting
energy increases at the rate of 22meV/%Sb resulting in a crossover with the band
gap energy Eg for Sb = 27% and N = 10% and a resonant energy of 0.44 eV. Hence
GaAsNSb alloys with a spin-orbit splitting energy larger than the band gap can be
used to design potential Auger and leakage free devices operating in the long
wavelength regime. Calculation of effective masses indicate that unlike the dilute
nitrides, the electron mobility in GaAsNSb alloys increases for y>3% and the hole
mobility decreases with the increase in Sb concentration. VBO and CBO as well
their ratios are calculated as function of both Sb and N mole fraction. CBO as high
as 500 meV and VBO of 120 meV is obtained which can improve the device
characteristics by providing strong carrier confinement. Band gap values of 0.75
eV and 1.22 eV are obtained for tensile strained GaAs0.94N0.05Sb0.01/GaAs QW
and compressive strained GaAs0.94N0.01Sb0.05/GaAs QWs respectively. The
splitting between LH and HH sub bands are observed in case of tensile strained
QWs. For QWs, CBO shows a non-linear increase and is almost ten times greater
*
*
*
than the LH and HH related VBO. The effective masses mcb
 mhh and mso

decrease with the increase in Sb concentration, mlh*  increases for compressive
strained GaAsSbN/GaAs QWs in the crystal direction [100]. It is also shown that it
is possible to achieve emission at telecommunication windows (i.e., 1.3 µm and
1.55 µm) for GaAs-based lasers containing GaAsNSb/GaAs QWs.
In future we would like to investigate the optoelectronic devices like Photo
detector, LASER diode and Solar cell by using our investigated materials GaSbBi
and GaAsSbN. The detailed device simulation and fabrication would help to enrich
and support our recent work.
